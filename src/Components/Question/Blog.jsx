                <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold'>When Should You Context API?</h1>
                <p className='text-xl'>we should use the Context API in React when you have data that needs to be accessed by multiple components at different levels. It is particularly useful when you have global data that needs to be accessed by many components. However, use it judiciously and with care as using it improperly can make your code complex and affect performance.</p>

            <p className='text-xl'>In React, useMemo is a hook that memoizes a function and caches its result to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-computation on re-renders.</p>
